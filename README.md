====================

Mock up of using an Icicle chart to make and interactive Source/Fund page.

[View on Github Pages](http://sskeller.github.io/jsfiddles-eis-icicle/)

Suggestions:
============

 - [ ] Better navigation back up to the upper levels of the plan  
 - [ ] Hide IPM Sub-Funds in icicle, but show in tables below. Icicle becomes only three levels.  
 - [ ] Hover effects for the icicle, legend and table to help associate them  
 - [ ] Hover popup in icicle with fund name, %, etc  
 - [ ] Download PDF link that shows all tables
