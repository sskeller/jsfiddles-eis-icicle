Suggestions:
============

  [ ] Hide IPM Sub-Funds in icicle, but show in tables below. Icicle becomes only three levels.  
  [ ] Hover effects for the icicle, legend and table to help associate them  
  [ ] Hover popup in icicle with fund name, %, etc  
  [ ] Download PDF link that shows all tables  
  [ ] Better navigation back up to the upper levels of the plan
